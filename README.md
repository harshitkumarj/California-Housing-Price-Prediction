# California-Housing-Price-Prediction

## Goals
**Can the data help to predict the housing prices?**
The project also aims at building a model of housing prices to predict median house values in California using the provided dataset. This model should learn from the data and be able to predict the median housing price in any district, given all the other metrics.
